### Hi everybody :raising_hand:
<br>
<p>My name is Giulio Attilio Pietroluongo and I'm a Front-End Developer from Brazil. I started to learn Coding in 2023 after realized that I have plenty of free time in my current job as a Professional Pilot in a private jet :airplane:. 
<p>As I always wanted to be part of the Programming world, my goal is to boost my knowledge and my skills aiming to be part of this fascinating technological universe. 
<p>Feel free to give me advices to improve my codes.
